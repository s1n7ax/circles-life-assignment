A simple framework where you can start working on your tests right away.
(Just wanted to prove myself to companies that I'm capable of creating a Selenium framework. :D)

## Features
* Parallel execution 
* Supports Linux & Windows (You can override or extend supported platforms easily)
* Supports Chrome & Firefox (You can override or extend supported browsers easily)
* Do you want to run different test cases on different browsers using different driver versions, concurrently? You can do that (Guide will be updated soon... :))

## Prerequisite
* Java 10 or higher (some Java 10 features are being used)

* Eclipse with TestNG plugin will make things so much easier.
